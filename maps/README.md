# Maps

This directory contains maps for the Nuggets game.
Feel free to add your own.

* `contrib`: maps contributed by student teams in 2019S.

* `big.txt`: a very large map
* `challenge.txt`: a very tricky map
* `edges.txt`: a small map that bumps into the edges of the grid
* `fewspots.txt`: a map with too-few empty spots to support a game with 26 players and many gold piles.
* `hole.txt`: a map in which one room has a hole in it
* `main.txt`: an interesting map for playing and testing.
* `narrow.txt`: a very narrow map that will fit in a very narrow window; what happens to the top line of your player's display?
* `small.txt`: a simple, small map; also too-few empty spots.
